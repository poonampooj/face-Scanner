This repository features a Python-based face detection project powered by a pre-trained model from Google Teachable Machine. It provides an intuitive and efficient solution for detecting faces in images and real-time video streams, leveraging machine learning techniques.  

## Features  
- Detects faces in both images and real-time video.  
- Utilizes a pre-trained model from Google Teachable Machine.  
- Beginner-friendly and easy to customize.  

## Prerequisites  
- Python 3.7 or higher  
- OpenCV library  
- NumPy library  
- A pre-trained face model from Google Teachable Machine  

## Installation Steps for FaceScannerr+  
### Step 1: Access Google Teachable Machine  
- Open Google Chrome and go to the [Google Teachable Machine website](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/). Click **Get Started**.  

### Step 2: Create a New Project  
- In the **New Project** section, select the **Image Model** folder.  

### Step 3: Choose a Model Type  
- Select the **Standard Image Model** option.  

### Step 4: Train the Model  
- Define the required classes and upload images using your webcam or Google Drive.  
- Train the model and observe the comparison percentages for the classes provided.  

### Step 5: Export the Model  
- After training, click **Export Model**.  

### Step 6: Download the Model  
- Under the **TensorFlow** tab, select **Download the Model**. A `.zip` file will be downloaded.  

### Step 7: Set Up Your Local System  
1. Extract the `.zip` file and copy the `.h5` and `.txt` files.  
2. Save these files to your project directory.  

### Step 8: Prepare the Code  
- Paste the provided code into PyCharm or any other Python IDE.  

### Step 9: Install Required Libraries  
- Open the terminal and install the necessary libraries for the project.  
- Ensure you are using compatible Python and TensorFlow versions to avoid syntax errors.  

### Step 10: Run the Code  
- Execute the script, and the **FaceScanner** application will begin working successfully.
